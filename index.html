                    <p>
                        I have a strong background in software engineering and systems management, where I’ve
                        consistently focused on driving innovation and operational efficiency. Throughout my career,
                        I’ve had the opportunity to design and implement solutions for performance-critical
                        environments, often working collaboratively with cross-functional teams to meet demanding
                        operational metrics. My approach is iterative, ensuring that every project I’m involved in goes
                        through continuous refinement to optimize both reliability and performance.

                        My passion for research has led me to delve deeply into fields like Natural Language Processing
                        (NLP) and information security. I’ve worked extensively on training models for data processing,
                        especially in addressing challenges related to sensitive information. This combination of
                        practical experience and analytical thinking has enabled me to tackle complex technical problems
                        effectively.

                        I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering and have additional certifications in systems
                        administration, which have given me a solid grounding in networking and security monitoring. My
                        career began in system and security roles, where I honed my skills in threat prevention and
                        monitoring network events, experiences that continue to influence my approach to problem-solving
                        today.

                        Beyond my professional roles, I’m passionate about mentoring and coaching. I volunteer as a
                        coach for students in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, helping them navigate
                        both theoretical and practical aspects of these fields. I take pride in guiding students through
                        challenges and sharing the insights I’ve gained throughout my career, which I believe is just as
                        rewarding as the technical work itself.
